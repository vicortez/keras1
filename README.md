# keras1
In this project, we use the CIFAR 10 dataset, and the keras framework in python, to classify images of vehicles into four classes: planes, cars, boats and trucks. Both test and evaluation are done using images from CIFAR10.

We also use the CIFAR100 dataset to get examples of the classes we want, then train a separate neural network to classify images for those classes.
